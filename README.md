# Florist-site

My first go at a website! Not yet finished - the possibilities are endless...
Next up is a working 'orders' area..
I used an event booking app tutorial from FreeCodeCamp for the base code, but then ran away with my ideas!
Please make suggestions or comments on the code...
I started to learn CSS/html on 20th July.
